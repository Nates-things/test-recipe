# test-recipe
Description (optional) does this have a character yes 350, nope now its a read me nice editor too

yep  
    COOL
so am I actuall considering typeing my recipes up and orgnizing them into projects and branches when I change them?
sure fuck it 

okay cool the mobile text editors pretty good too. so the read me will be the recipe and the repository goes into the project and the repositories get like paths?
so this is a modified recipe named branch one so like its modified so like shreaded chicken if I changed the cook time or spice mix I could put it here take notes on if it was better and potentlly make it the main or just leave it as a strange artifact on github
